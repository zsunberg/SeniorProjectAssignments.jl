# Senior Projects Preference Survey

## 1. Groups (not required)

You may request assignment in groups of 2 or 3. Your group is guaranteed assignment to the same project. The other members of your group MUST also enter your name for the group to be valid.

If you would like to request assignment as part of a group, please select the names of the other group members:

Teammate 1:
<select name="t1">
    <option></option>
    <option>Alice</option>
    <option>Bob</option>
    <option>Charlie</option>
</select>

    <option>Alice</option>
    <option>Bob</option>
    <option>Charlie</option>
</select>

## 2. Roles and Expertise (required)

## 3. Project Preferences (required)

Please indicate which projects you would prefer to work on. If you request assignment in a group, you MUST indicate the same ordering as the other group members. If you do not, the ordering provided by a random member of the group will be used for the entire group.

[NOTE TO JOSH: It would be cool if this was a drag-n-drop ordering]
